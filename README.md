# grammar-check

This project was made for an Artificial Technology module at Swansea University.

To see how it works go to https://swish.swi-prolog.org/ create a notebook and copy the contents of the file into it. 

Then input a command on the right text box with the format of s(Tree,[the,woman,sees,the,apples], []) as an example. The commented out section shows the inputs and outputs required for the project to succeed. If the program returns False then it is not a proper sentance or the words used are not in the dictionary of the project.
